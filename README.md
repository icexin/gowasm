gowasm
======

Overview
========

gowasm is a go runtime implemention for WebAssembly generated by go(>=1.11) toolchain.
It is also an extensible framework, you can freely add packages for the wasm module to access methods in these packages.

How to use
=============

gowasm is just a runtime implementation, it requires a wasm vm to run the code.

There are currently two vm implementations, [life](https://github.perlin-network/life) and [wagon](https://github.com/go-interpreter/wagon).

The compilation method is as follows

``` bash
$ GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build tests/hello.go
$ export GO111MODULE=on

# For life vm
$ go get github.com/icexin/gowasm/cmd/life
$ life hello wasm


# For wagon vm 
$ go get github.com/icexin/gowasm/cmd/wagon
$ wagon hello wasm
```
